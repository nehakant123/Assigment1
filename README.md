**Project:-GESTURE BASED TEXT RECOGNITION**
This project demonstrates one way in which computers can interpret human gestures. In today's world, we see advanced versions of this technology in applications such as **Tesla's** 
self-driving cars, which use similar deep learning programs to automate driving, and **recommendation systems** on various apps that suggest popular web series or movies. This project 
takes us on a journey through the basics of these advanced systems, providing a foundational understanding of how they are developed.
This project first enhanced my Python coding skills and then taught me the basics of machine learning. The best part was learning about **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and 
implementing various **OpenCV and MediaPipe projects**, such as creating a **face mesh** and a **hand detector**.

this project works in a very simple manner firstly it opens computers camera and creates a imaginary canvas using openCV and various mediapipe pakages now we can write anything on 
the canvas in range of the data set included in the CNN module.After writing now its job of the CNN model to train the neural network and show the desired result.
